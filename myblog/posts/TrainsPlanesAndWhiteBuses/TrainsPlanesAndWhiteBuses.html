		<h1>Trains, Planes, and White Buses</h1><br/>

		<h2>4/1/2019</h2><br/>

		<img src="images/bus.jpg" class="widerpic"><br/><br/>

		<p>My plan was simple. I’d catch a bus from Hartford to New York City. Then, I’d hail a taxi to other bus station and get an overnight bus to Indianapolis, studying for my Calc 3 midterm on the drive up. Five companies. Five coding interviews. I’d impress them all with my infinite charm and wit and be up to my shoulders in internship offers. On the ride back, I’d study for my Social Psych midterm, which conclude with my getting back to my dorm, sleeping for two hours, waking up, and preparing for a phone interview with Google. After which, I’d ace the two midterms.</p>

		<p>My plan was simple.</p>

		<p>“Uh, I don’t think there’s even a bus station there, man,” said the Uber driver after looking at the address I had locked in. “That’s the middle of the poor part of Chinatown. There’s nothing there but delis and hotels.”</p>

		<p>I told him to drive anyway. Nothing could stand in my way. My plan was simple.</p>

		<p>“Here we are, I guess,” he uttered, audibly bothered at the prospect of leaving me here. “If you want me to take you somewhere else, I can.</p>

		<p>The walls were covered in graffiti. A nearby convenience store had windows outfitted thick metal bars. Copious amounts of grey fumes rose from an open manhole. All the signs were in a language that I didn’t speak. The air was so cold and stiff that I could feel its bite through my four layers of coats. It was one in the morning.</p>

		<p>“This is fine,” I said.</p>

		<p>“Eh, okay.” The cabbie and – with him – the only familiar part of the environment disappeared. What did I care that there wasn’t a bus station in sight? After all, my plan was simple.</p>

		<p>I stood in the cold, contemplating my next decision. I had plenty of time – an hour and a half – and absolutely no idea from where the bus would leave. I needed directions, but from whom? The convenience store seemed like a good option.</p>

		<p>“Hey. I’m looking for a bus station,” I said. The man glared up at me from his phone, peered outside at the New York traffic, and smiled.</p>

		<p>“No station. Just bus.”</p>

		<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>

		<p>He pointed outside. Large brand-less white buses would stop in the middle of the street. Thereafter, pedestrians would sprint across traffic and into the buses. After around thirty seconds, the bus would take off, leaving no trace that it had been there.</p>

		<p>“How will I know which one is mine,” I asked.</p>

		<p>The man shrugged.</p>

		<p>My plan, though altered, was still simple. Now, I had to run after every group of loiterers to ask if they’re waiting for the Indianapolis bus. Most weren’t and didn’t seem to appreciate my company. Finally, I asked an elderly couple who said they were going to the same place.</p>

		<p>Thirty minutes passed, and no bus appeared. I checked my watch. 2:00 AM. We were going to be late.</p>

		<p>Another half hour passed.</p>

		<p>Then another.</p>

		<p>Eventually, a woman in a polo shirt ran out from a nearby unmarked building and yelled something in a foreign language at us. Many members of the crowd let out a sigh of relief, picked up their luggage, and began following the woman. I followed.</p>

		<p>She took us around the block to a more secluded location, which housed yet another suspicious white bus. The door opened, and we all boarded.</p>

		<p>After putting my stuff down, I went to the bathroom in the back. The floor was covered in urine. This was fine, I thought, trying to remain optimistic. I could be strategic about where I stood.</p>

		<p>That’s when the driver floored it.</p>

		<p>Stumbling back to my seat with contaminated shoes and pants, I sat next to a guy I didn’t know. He seemed fine until he pulled out his phone and started skyping some girl and never stopped: they skyped the entire 14-hour drive there.</p>

		<p>As to be expected, there was yet another flaw in my master plan: the bus had no wi-fi, meaning that studying for my midterms would be impossible.</p>

		<p>Good, I thought. An already simple plan was just made simpler. I rolled over and tried to sleep.</p>

		<p>I couldn’t. The driver seemed to be taking a very indirect route to Indianapolis, dragging us through the dirt road backwoods of upstate New York and causing so much turbulence that rest was impossible. I listened to a Clive Barker audiobook instead.</p>

		<p>The entire duration of The Hellbound Heart later, I drifted off.</p>

		<p>As I opened my eyes, it occurred to me that I wouldn’t be able to bathe or brush my teeth before my interviews. I pulled out my phone and looked at myself in the front-facing camera. Perfection, I thought.</p>

		<p>We stopped in the parking lot of a Denny’s at 1:30 PM, an hour late to my first interview. I couldn’t get a solid connection to email the company about the situation, and when I eventually did, they never replied.</p>

		<p>I called an Uber to drive me the remainder of the way to my destination.</p>

		<p>“Can you deal with the navigation stuff? It’s a lot to do both at the same time,” he said.</p>

		<p>“Sure.”</p>

		<p>“Thanks, bud. Did you know Elvis used to play at that casino? Me and the wife are big Elvis fans. Got every record.”</p>

		<p>“I didn’t know that.”</p>

		<p>“Course, he stopped going there around the time he had a kid. Did you know his daughter married Nic Cage?”</p>

		<p>“I didn’t know that.”</p>

		<p>The driver fit as much Elvis trivia as he could into our half hour together. When he dropped me off, I went inside the building of the event, and shook my interviewer’s hand.</p>

		<p>“How are you doing,” she asked.</p>

		<p>How was I doing? I spent the previous evening wandering through Chinatown past midnight in search of the one brand-less bus that was going to Indianapolis, which resulted in 14 hours of a urine-reeked bathroom, bumpy roads, and an uncomfortably long skype call. After I finished with the interviews, I’d get to do it all again, go back to Wesleyan, fail two midterms, and bomb a phone interview.</p>

		<p>“Fine,” I said. “I’m doing fine.”</p>
