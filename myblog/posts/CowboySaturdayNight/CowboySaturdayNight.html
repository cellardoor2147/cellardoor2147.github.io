		<h1>Cowboy Saturday Night</h1><br/>

		<h2>3/13/2019</h2><br/>

		<p>There’s something to be said about the idealization of southern culture. In popular media, the south is usually depicted as either a sand dune – populated by only the roughest and toughest outlaws this side of the Mississippi – or a trailer part – inhabited solely by tobacco-spitting revolver-holstering overall-wearing hicks. Truthfully, neither of these theories reign supreme; they’re both, in their own niche ways, accurate.</p>

		<p>It’s an Oklahoman hunter’s tradition to make their children take a bite out of the still-beating heart of their first deer kill. Certain rural towns’ politicians gain voters by out-performing their competitors at bull riding. It seems to me futile to convince others that things like this are a reality in certain southern communities. Yet, for reasons I can’t begin to understand, there’s something innately captivating about the culture. And, at least around my slice of the south, one tradition “out-souths” all others: Cowboy Saturday Night.</p>

		<p>Think about a church. Now lower your standards. Imagine, rather than the larger grandiose architecture you’re probably used to, that the church is a 60-foot-by-60-foot wooden box with concrete floors. The cheap white paint is peeling, faded, and covering the entire building, even the windows. A few cracked steps lead up to a door and are complemented by a concrete ramp of questionable stability. The nearby parking lot is full of beat-up pre-Vietnam Fords and Chevys, most of which are plastered with confederate flags and “John McCain in ‘08” bumper stickers. An older woman struggles her way up the ramp, holding a dreadful-looking casserole. Accompanying the lady is an older man, who approaches a nearby family of four, extends his hand, and shouts, “Yeeeeeeeeeeehaw. Praised be his holy name!” The blistering, dry heat makes the buzzing of flies and screaming of cicadas seem tolerable by comparison.</p>

		<p>That’s a good description of my Saturday nights as a child visiting my grandparents for the summer. I sat in the front with my Memaw who, along with my Papa, would spend roughly thirty minutes tuning their instruments and greeting attendees. There was an occasional loud SNAP from outside, but I knew not to worry. It was merely Dalton Olson and the rest of the good ol’ boys having a round of target practice before the service. Every now and then, I’d hear the familiar, “Yeeeeeeeeeeehaw. Praised be his holy name!” That was somewhat of a catchphrase.</p>

		<p>Then, when Jimmy Criquet rang the church bell, everyone came inside and took their seats.</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">“It’s so good to see ya’ll here, folks,” Jimmy would holler. “And I’ll tell ya what, folks, we have a good one in store for ya today!”</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">He’d step down from the podium only to be replaced by my Memaw and Papa. Then, like clockwork, we’d all stand and dance to the inaugural tune:</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">“It’s Cowboy Saturday Night! (Yes it is!)</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">It’s Cowboy Saturday Night! (Yeehaw!)</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">We’ll praise his name alright,</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">On Cowboy Saturday Night!</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">He went up on that tree</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">To die for you and me!</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">For all eternity</p>

		<p style="font-style: italic">We all will be set free!" (X2)</p>

		<p>Usually out of tempo, attendees would stomp their boots and shout things along the lines of “Amen, Jesus!”</p>

		<p>Throughout every service, my mind would wonder. I’d think about what was going on with my old friends in Texas, play a mental game of chess with myself until I lost track of where the pieces were, or count people’s hats.</p>

		<p>Frequently, though, I’d think of my Papa. He spent many of his younger years as a director of machinists, technicians, and engineers for a company that produced jet engines. He knew who Emmanuel Kant was. He wrote beautiful poetry about exploring the cosmos. In many ways, my Papa was an intelligent, well-rounded man. Yet, there he was, stomping his feet, strumming a banjo, and shouting “yeehaw” to the rhythm of Cowboy Saturday Night.</p>

		<p>Seven years later, I thought on it again, sitting on a weak, rustic chair at my Papa’s funeral. Why did he waste his time entertaining the salt of the earth? The conclusion I reached and have since reinforced is only speculation but nonetheless valid: he did it because he, too, was the salt of the earth. My Papa never viewed himself as anything but a country boy. His time working on jet engines was merely a means to the end of retiring in the community of his choice, rural Oklahoma. To him, the intricacies of southern culture superseded the ignorance of northerners. Cowboy Saturday Night, despite its quirkiness, was and is essential. The boot stomping, yeehaw-ing, and target practicing traditions of the south added life and meaning to what would otherwise be a series of sparse blue-collar communities in the hills, mountains, and backwoods. </p>
