		<h1>Convincing My Friends to Join a Cult</h1><br/>

		<h2>3/11/2019</h2><br/>

		<p>The sight of my charred Pokemon  game cartridge was bittersweet. On one hand, burning things in the barbecue was cool. On the other, my father had made me do it. To him, Pokemon wasn’t merely a form of escapism. Rather, it was a portal. A gateway drug. A means by which perfectly reasonably protestants fell from God’s grace.</p>

		<p>I walked back inside. My father followed, extending his arm to shut the screen door as I pulled to open it. I turned to him, desperate for a sliver of reason. I would get none.</p>

		<p>“It ain’t what God wants,” my father uttered. “In this world, you either do what the big man wants, or you burn in hell. Which one is it gonna be for you?”</p>

		<p>I ducked around him, entered my room, and laid on my bed. Which one would it be for me? I liked the idea of going to heaven. Memaw would be there. Then again, so would every other bland attendee of my parents’ church of choice, First Baptist. Hell, it seemed to me, had no room for the pious blank slates of First Baptist. It was a place for the wretches of history, like James Hetfield - the lead singer of Metallica - or John Romero - the creative director behind my favorite game, Doom. It was Hell, I decided, that I’d preferably go to when I died.</p>

		<p>My father’s distaste for what he called “the occult’s media” didn’t extend merely to japanese video games. It encompassed violent movies, like the cult classic Evil Dead 2. It included heavy metal bands, ranging anywhere from Megadeth to Slipknot. Above all, my father hated tabletop roleplaying games. To him, when a player rolled the dice to determine the outcome of an imaginary fireball, they weren’t just toying with the properties of statistics. They were calling on demonic spirits.</p>

		<p>For obvious reasons, I couldn’t get parental support in purchasing tabletop RPG materials, like the Dungeons and Dragons Player’s Handbook or the GURPS Basic Set. So, I thought, I’d just have to create my own system.</p>

		<p>The rules were simple. Each player had a number of stats: might, wit, health, and charm. Might determined how physically strong a player was, wit decided their intellect, health dictated how much damage they could take, and charm determined how adept they were at persuading others. Each stat numbered anywhere from 1 to 6. In order to see if the player could prevent a steel door from closing, for example, they’d roll a six-sided die and try to get it below their might stat.</p>

		<p>I showed my friends, Brandyn and Jacob, both of whom were enamored with the system’s simplicity. Brandyn took out his notebook, wrote several pages of fantasy lore, and served as the “game master” for our first campaign. We played during breakfast before school, under the monkey bars at recess, and on the bus ride home. It didn’t take long for the administration to take notice.</p>

		<p>Principal Hull had a sign on the door to his office, which read, “Remember: It’s PrinciPAL because he’s your pal!” It was hard to appreciate the sign’s message when the door flung open, revealing a fuming, beet-red PrinciPAL.</p>

		<p>“I don’t want that… that… that… garbage played during class time, ya hear?” Hull, a member of the previously mentioned pious blank slate variety, was perceivably attempting to construct a pretext. My friends and I didn’t play our game during class time, which he knew. However, that was never the problem. Our game’s influence from tabletop RPGs, a pastime regularly derided as synonymous with virgin sacrifice by men like Hull or my father, was the problem. Though, when Hull requested from the school board a ban on tabletop RPG paraphernalia, he didn’t do so on the excuse that our game was evil; he did so on the lie that we had been playing in class.</p>

		<p>In many ways, Wesleyan is a breath of fresh air. The food’s good. Classes are fun and informational. Most interestingly, however, I get to play Dungeons and Dragons with other hellbound heathens like myself. If only Hull or my father could have saved me.</p>
