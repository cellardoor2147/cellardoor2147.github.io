		<h1>The Girl in the Overalls</h1><br/>

		<h2>3/10/2019</h2><br/>

		<p>Before she said it, I thought we could be friends. “Why doesn’t Wesleyan use financial aid to pay for on-campus massages?”</p>

		<p>I thought back to my ninth birthday. The park bench.  Mom and Dad hurling expletives at someone - likely a bank teller - on the phone, no-doubt frustrated with defaulted loans and a lost house.</p>

		<p>Then, I imagined this girl’s ninth birthday. A pool party in the backyard of a $300,000 estate. Goofy happy-go-lucky parents getting off early from their office jobs in order to pick up their daughter’s gift.</p>

		<p>Would a massage have paid my parents’ debt and prevented our homelessness?</p>

		<p>I wondered if her gift was a private masseuse.</p>

		<p>Upon hearing that the topic of my rant would be low-income oppression, my peer, Katie, seemed disinterested. She didn’t seem concerned with the fact that another student had suggested the thread keeping Wesleyan affordable for me be replaced by a massage parlor.</p>

		<p>I didn’t blame her. Beyond complaining, what had I ever done to combat the marginalization of the impoverished?</p>

		<p>It was during this self-reflection that my phone vibrated. Monica Brinkley, my high school chemistry teacher, wanted me to speak over the Winter break to her students about the college application.</p>

		<p>Upon arrival to her classroom, one thing was evident: rural Oklahoman students don’t come from money.  Most of the class, Mrs. Brinkley included, had difficulty finding scholarships worth applying to; they cited a lack of some centralized hub as a challenge. I asked if they had looked into financial aid.</p>

		<p>“What’s that,” a student asked.</p>

		<p>I examined her clothing: ragged overalls overlaying a stained white shirt. In many ways both physical and abstract, her appearance was distinct from that of a Canada-Goose-jacket-wearing Wesleyan student. How could she be expected to understand a process that was meant to filter her out?</p>

		<p>“It’s how I afford college,” I replied.</p>

		<p>Given this situation, Katie readily agreed to act as a graphic designer and contributing writer to my proposition: the CAF project. The College Application Fairness project is not designed to spite Wesleyan’s elitist populous. Rather, it’s meant to prevent ignorant massage-loving complacence from impeding the success of the girl in overalls.</p>
