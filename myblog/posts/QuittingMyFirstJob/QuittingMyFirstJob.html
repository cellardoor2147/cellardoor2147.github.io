		<h1>Quitting My First Job</h1><br/>

		<h2>4/6/2019</h2><br/>

		<img src="images/dollargeneral.jpg" class="widerpic"><br/><br/>

		<p>I didn’t care much for my job at Dollar General, partly because of the low wages, the heat, and a plethora of other miscellaneous annoyances. Mostly, though, I disliked certain customers. Most weren’t bad. Jimmy Criquet would come in every now and then, purchase a single loaf of bread, and give me his patented smile. In many cases, the customers were the best part of working there.</p>

		<p>A similar effect occurred on the first day of every month, on which most blue-collar Oklahomans got paid. These days, for reasons I can’t begin to comprehend, attracted mothers of the “I’d like to speak to the manager” variety. To them, every inconvenience, regardless of how seemingly miniscule or irrelevant they were, could be attributed to the slothfulness of workers. A messy toy section, for example, wasn’t the fault of complacent soccer moms allowing their children to terrorize the store. Rather, it was the cashier’s burden to bear.</p>

		<p>Clocking in, I cringed when the terminal displayed the date. On that day, I’d be getting the worst of both worlds. Not only would customers come to spend their monthly checks; they’d come in preparation for the south’s favorite holiday: the date was July 1st, Dollar General’s busiest, meanest day of the year.</p>

		<p>I stood sheepishly behind the counter. Customers were already piling in. It wasn’t long until my aisle had its first customer, a man with oil-stained hair and tattered overalls. He carried with him a bag of frozen chicken wings and a pack of Rolling Rock.</p>

		<p>“What do I owe ya,” he asked.</p>

		<p>“$15.25,” I replied.</p>

		<p>He reached into his wallet and gave me his license. As I was scanning it, he surveyed the area – as though he was about to do something mischievous – and leaned in.</p>

		<p>“What?”</p>

		<p>“Mexicans. You got a problem with goofs about ‘em?”</p>

		<p>Before I could answer, he told me a raunchy slur-filled joke and grinned oafishly, clearly expecting laughter. I returned his license, and he left.</p>

		<p>By noon, we had hit our peak customer count. The line extended out the door and nearly around the block. A young woman wearing an army wife shirt came to the front. She had three kids, all of which were running around and yelling. Oddly, she didn’t have a basket or any items to speak of. Rather than loading items onto the conveyer belt, she merely looked at me, seemingly disapproving the fact that I existed.</p>

		<p>“What can I help you with,” I asked.</p>

		<p>She looked at me for a few more seconds without saying anything. Then, she reached into her purse, removed a small squeak toy, and placed it on the counter.</p>

		<p>“I’m returning this,” she replied.</p>

		<p>“I can’t do returns. I can have my manager set up another aisle and return the item for you there, though.”</p>

		<p>“I’m not moving.”</p>

		<p>“But I can’t do –”</p>

		<p>“I don’t care.”</p>

		<p>“Ma’am. There’s a line –”</p>

		<p>“I’m not moving.”</p>

		<p>The line was stalled for fifteen minutes before my manager eventually set up another aisle. At which point, the army wife exchanged the small squeak toy for a Dollar General gift card valued at 79 cents.</p>

		<p>An hour or so later, another interesting figure came to the front: a lanky middle-aged woman wearing a denim jacket and fingerless gloves. She slammed a 24-pack of Coolers Light on the counter.</p>

		<p>“Do you have an ID,” I asked.</p>

		<p>“Don’t got one on me,” she replied. “Two, twenty-four, sixty-eight.”</p>

		<p>“What?”</p>

		<p>“My birthdate. Two, twenty-four, sixty-eight.”</p>

		<p>“Ma’am, I can’t sell you alcohol without an ID. There are cameras all over this store.”</p>

		<p>“Two, twenty-four, sixty-eight.”</p>

		<p>“I can’t.”</p>

		<p>“Houston,” she whispered, leaning in merely a few inches from my face. “We got a problem. Two. Twenty-four. Sixty-eight.”</p>

		<p>“What?”</p>

		<p>“Houston. We got ourselves a big, big problem.”</p>

		<p>“This sucks,” I uttered, walking out from behind the counter and out the front door.</p>

		<p>Starting up my car’s engine, I drove onto the highway.</p>

		<p>A few weeks prior, I had received my acceptance letter from Wesleyan. Each morning, I’d wake up to the sounds of cicadas outside my trailer and lie in my bed, contemplating the odd juxtaposition of my transition into Wesleyan. Would I fit in at Wesleyan?</p>

		<p>When I turned onto the gravel road, my car’s hood unhinged, slamming against and shattering the front window. I spiraled out into a ditch, crashing into a fence shrouded in tall bluegrass.</p>

		<p>I didn’t fit in at Cordell. I was a lackluster athlete and – seeing as most rural Oklahomans’ interests lie in fishing and mudding – a so-so conversationalist.</p>

		<p>I got out of the car and stood in the middle of the road, waiting for someone to drive by.</p>

		<p>I missed my parents. We had gotten into a lot of altercations, most of which I didn’t regret in the slightest. Though, I was remorseful for my deteriorated relationship with them. It was my dad, mostly. Without boring you with the cliché details, he drank too much and got violent. My mother’s only problem was her complacency with his transgressions. Should I have forgiven them if it meant regaining their company?</p>

		<p>Removing bits of glass from my hair, I noticed a small truck heading my way.</p>

		<p>Everybody wants companionship. I just wasn’t particularly good at attaining it. It seemed that in every area of my life, I had tarnished someone’s perception of me. I considered the oddity of defining my self-worth around something I had little control over. “This sucks,” I thought. I didn’t need to fit in. I just needed to be happy.</p>

		<p>I accepted the trucker’s invitation to drive me into town, leaving the wreckage of my totaled Monte Carlo behind.</p>
